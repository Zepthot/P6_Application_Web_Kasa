# [OC] Project 6 : Create a real estate rental web application with React
This repository contains the HTML/CSS/JS code to address the problem of the sixth OpenClassrooms project.

## Context

With more than 500 ads posted every day, Kasa is one of the leading apartment rental sites in France.

Kasa is recruiting me as a freelance front-end developer to develop its new web platform.
